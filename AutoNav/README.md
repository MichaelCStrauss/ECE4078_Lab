# Group 2_12 Milestone Two Submission

This is our submission for the second milestone, SLAM. 

## Notes

Please see the screen recording attached.

It features a run of 89% (7/16 on marker locations, 14/16 on total marker detection, 100% on paths and time.)

Please note that our implementation *does not* depend on the system FPS, and only uses the *real time elapsed*. Therefore, the multiplication based on system FPS should not need to apply to our runs.
